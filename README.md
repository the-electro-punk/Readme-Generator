# Readme-Generator

# Description
This is a basic javascript code meant to generate a basic README file. The user inputs a filename, then a header, and finally some basic content. This was the point I started learning more complex coding as this javascript file (index-updated.js) uses inquirer prompt to gather the necessary information, then organizes the data (as designed by the code), then finally appends it and submits the new README in the same folder as the index-updated file. This was my first time using inquirer prompt so I created a basic version; I have since learned how to create more (relatively) complex prompts.

# How to run the project

From the index-updated file, open the command line and type in node index-updated.js. The user is then asked three questions where the user inputs the filename (add ".md" so it knows what filetype to create), the header, and a basic sentence/paragraph for the content.

# Credits

While I was the sole person working most of these assignments, I usually received help from classmates, instructors, and online tutorials for help better understanding certain concepts.
